# Soundry

Soundry is an experimental parser for the SFZ file format, written in Rust that intends to be capable of handling both SFZ versions. As well, it intends to implement the full set of opcodes for various headers, and ideally, parse SFZ files programmatically depending on the tools that would use the parser. For example, Meadlowlark is a Rust based DAW, for which someone could use Soundry to develop a synthesizer plugin that provides instruments, synths, and the like.
